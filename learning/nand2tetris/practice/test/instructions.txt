--- COMP557 in-class test 1 ---

Edit the three hdl files according to the instructions below:

ict1/q1/Or.hdl
ict1/q2/HalfAdder.hdl
ict1/q3/Mux.hdl

Do not edit or create other files (generated files are OK to leave in place).

Use the Hardware Simulator in the ict1-11/tools directory and the .tst files in each question directory to test your chips.

Once you have completed the three questions, compress the entire ict1-11 directory and submit it to Moodle.
To compress on Windows: right-click the folder, select 'Send to', and then select 'Compressed (zipped) folder'.
To compress on Mac: right-click the folder, select 'Compress "ict1-11"'.

Please submit 35 minutes after you start.
Students with ILPs should stick to the following times:
adding 25% is about 44 minutes,
adding 33% is about 47 minutes,
adding 50% is about 50 minutes.
In each case, I will allow a grace period.


--- ict1-11/q1/Or.hdl [4 marks] ---

Build an Or gate using only Nand gates.

The built-in Nand has inputs 'a','b', output 'out', and the following truth table:

|   a   |   b   |  out  |
|   0   |   0   |   1   |
|   0   |   1   |   1   |
|   1   |   0   |   1   |
|   1   |   1   |   0   |


--- ict1-11/q2/HalfAdder.hdl [4 marks] ---

Build a half adder using built-in And, Or, Not, Xor, Nand or Nor chips.
It should sum 1-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' to produce 1-bit outputs 'sum' and 'carry'.


--- ict1-11/q3/Mux.hdl [2 marks] ---

Build a multiplexer using built-in And, Or, Not, Xor, Nand or Nor chips.
It should have inputs 'a','b' and 'sel' and output 'out'.
If 'sel' is set low, then 'out' should have the value of 'a'.
If 'sel' is set high, then 'out' should have the value of 'b'.


--- How it is marked ---

Each chip will be run against its accompanying .tst file.
If the submitted chip passes all tests in the .tst script, then it is awarded full marks.
If not, it gets zero marks (make sure to test your chips!).
